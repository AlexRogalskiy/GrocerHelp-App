## Inspiration

COVID-19 pandemic panic buying has emptied shelves of basic needs in all supermarkets, leaving various individuals in the community without access to the most basic needs. Even though supply chains are implementing measures to increase their stock levels, but fear of shortages of food and services are making their stock on site fluctuate every week and supermarkets become high-risk infection areas.

  

## What it does

GrocerHelp is a community-driven platform that helps users optimise their visit to the supermarket, by informing them about item availability in their nearest shops, while reducing their exposure to the virus, eliminating unnecessary movements to risk areas.

## How I built it

[FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) - As backend Database for storing information about various shops

[UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/) - For webscraping

The app is built using Android Native SDK tools with the following libraries.
[Google Maps API V2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)- for GeoFencing

[ButterKnife](https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) - for View Binding

[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - image loading framework for Android

[Okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - as android Http Client

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) - Easy Firebase Notifications

[Alerter](https://github.com/Tapadoo/Alerter) - For Material Style Alerts
  
  

## Challenges I ran into

Initially, Webscraping for data regarding various shops has become hectic. However, UiPaths powerful web scraping tool has made our job super simple.

Also, Using Firebase provided by Google Cloud Platform as database helped us to save lot of time.

  

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I was able to wireframe and design the whole app within a day.

Later within the next 12hrs, I was able to complete designing the whole functional prototype.

  

## What I learned

I learnt web scraping using UiPaths powerful web scraping tool.

I also learnt to integrate Firebase in Android.

  

## What's next for GrocerHelp App

Add several other stores like pharmaceuticals and restaurants where there is a high chance for crowding.
